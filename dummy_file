Hi,

I was following your article about npm cache at https://www.jonathan-wilkinson.com/github-actions-cache-everything and I spotted a typo.

Sorry for contacting you this way but I couldn't find an email or the option to comment on the article.

On the if statement, the step id should be cache-node-modules, not cache.

Thanks for sharing your knowledge.
